# Space Robotics Bench â€” Assets

This repository contains assets for the [**Space Robotics Bench**](https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/space_robotics_bench) initiative. It includes static 3D models, textures, HDRIs, and other resources for creating realistic space environments.

Although these assets are primarily intended for use within the Space Robotics Bench initiative, they are purposefully separated into this repository to allow for their independent use in other projects.

## Guidelines

Before using any of the assets, please refer to the [Attributions](#attributions) and [License](#license) sections below. In general, you can follow these guidelines for using the assets:

1. Review the list of [attributions](https://AndrejOrsula.github.io/space_robotics_bench/misc/attributions.html) and check if the asset you want to use is based on third-party resources.
   - If the asset is based on third-party resources and refers to the original license, make sure to comply with the original license terms. In most cases, you will need to give appropriate credit to the original author and indicate the changes made by you and the contributors of this repository (similar to the entry in the list).
